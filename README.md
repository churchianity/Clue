# Clue is a Programming Language

It sucks.

### The Goal

It will eventually, be a compiled language with full compile-time execution that supports the x86_64 architecture, C-like syntax (mostly meaning curly-braces), optional or vacant garbage-collection, an interpreted/sandbox mode, static-typing with plenty of simple and easy to use automatic type-inference, an emphasis on solid error messages, fast-compile time, a minimal number of dependencies, many configurable paramaters (when building from source as well as run-time parameters) and low-friction programming that is still roughly as low-level as you can get using C99 with inline assembly.

There is a ./doc/ directory which may have useful additional information, but it is almost certainly not completely up to date or accurate at the time of writing.
