- make array struct wrapper thingy

- import file search!

2. draw more clear distinctions between punctuators which have no meaning to a program, but have plenty of meaning to the compiler/interpreter

    func(foo: Int,  bar: String) {
        ...
        ...
        ...
        ...
        ...

        return;
    }

    {
    }
    [
    ]
    (
    )

    array[expr...]

            [
           / \
      array   index


    func(foo, bar)

            (
           / \
       func   list
              / \
            foo  bar


            (
          / |\
        /   | \
     func   |  \
           foo  bar

3. reporter needs a more lightweight api, message ids/something like that
