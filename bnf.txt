0. reporter whitespace
    - columns 0-indexed?



1. runtime stuff

    - at the moment, all numbers in this language are IEEE-754 64bit floating point aka DOUBLE.
        - strip trailing zeroes in some cases / know when to convert to int - use int sometimes?
        - modulus with floating point <math.h> remainder()

        - remove strtod, remove remainder(), remove pow()

2. punctuators!

    [ , ]
    when you see <]>, scan backwards and collect everything until we find <[>
    if, when we find a <[>, the token to the left of it is a symbol, then we have scanned across an array indexer
        array[<expression>]

    else, then we have scanned across an array literal
        ... [ <expression> , <expression> , ... ]

    ( , )
    when you see <)>, scan backwards and collect everything until we find <(>
    if, when we find a <(>, the token to left of it is a symbol, then we have scanned across a function call or definition
        if what we scanned across is a bunch of expressions, then it's a function call...
            func(<expression>, <expression>, ...)
            func();
            func().
            func() -

        else if what we scanned is a bunch of definitions, then it's a function definition
            func(<definition>, <definition>)
            func() { ... }

    else, then we have scanned across a group of sub-expressions
        (4 + 2 - x) * 5



  Some notes on grouping operators/punctuators as in [], {}, ()
  because they are weird...

  One way to deal with them is to treat openers as sentinels, and then treat the closers as a unary postfix
  operator, where their 'single' child is:

       )   -   an expression (used for grouping/precdence),
               a comma separated list of expressions (function call),
               a comma separated list of definitions (function arg definition)

       }   -   a comma separated list of tuples (dict literal), a group of statements or expressions (closure)
       ]   -   a comma separated list of expressions (array literal), a group of expressions (indexer)

       ? more bullshit ?
